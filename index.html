			Cartography encompasses the art and science of map-making, utilizing spatial data from various sources, including public government databases and demographic statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Throughout my Cartography course, I had the opportunity to develop my skills in visual communication and data representation.
<p>
			One of my significant projects was creating a map titled "Architecture of Melbourne's Sports Precinct." This project allowed me to explore the unique architectural elements and spatial relationships within this vibrant area. The process of designing this map enhanced my understanding of cartographic principles and the importance of effectively conveying information through visual means.
			<p>
			Below is the map I created, showcasing the architectural landscape of Melbourne's sports precinct.</p>

	<div class="paragraphs">
		Applied Geospatial Techniques (AGT) is a hands-on subject that combines Surveying, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Cartography to provide practical experience in real-world applications. In 2022, I completed a project designing an amphitheatre proposal at Deep Rock Oval, Yarra Bend Park.

The project involved creating several deliverables:
		<ul>
			<li>A detailed topographic survey map</li>
			<li>A 3D model of the proposed amphitheatre</li>
			<li>A site plan showing the amphitheatre and pathway layout</li>
			<li>A final presentation map highlighting the entire proposal</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			For the topographic survey, I collected data on-site using a total station, capturing precise elevation and location details. The data was processed using LISCAD.SEE and LISCAD.CAD to produce an accurate terrain map. The amphitheatre's 3D model was created in ArcScene, where raw data was refined in ArcMap to visualize the structure within its real-world environment.
		</p>
		One of the more complex aspects of the project was designing the pathway. Using ArcMap, I analyzed the siteâ€™s slope and elevation data to design an accessible route, ensuring structural feasibility by factoring in z-values and slope angles. The final map blended 2D and 3D elements, with the amphitheatre visualized in ArcMap and ArcScene providing a dynamic view of the overall design. To enhance the final presentation, I used Adobe Illustrator to improve clarity and visual appeal.
		<p>
			This project strengthened my technical proficiency in using industry-standard software like LISCAD, ArcMap, and ArcScene. It also honed my ability to integrate surveying, GIS, and cartography into a cohesive, real-world design. Overall, the project successfully applied geospatial science to urban planning, offering a professional-level proposal for landscape development.

		Since joining JCA Land Consultants in November 2022 as an Assistant Surveyor, I have gained hands-on experience in a variety of surveying tasks, including cadastral surveys, construction set-outs, and data processing. In the field, I have worked extensively with modern surveying equipment such as total stations and GPS systems to conduct accurate feature surveys, boundary re-establishments, and construction layouts. These projects have provided me with a solid understanding of the entire surveying process, from data collection to the production of final plans.
<p>
A significant aspect of my work involved re-establishment computations, where I aligned title boundaries with field occupations, solving complex surveying problems and ensuring precise outputs. One of the most notable projects I contributed to was the re-establishment of a crown allotment boundary in Ballarat, a project that required historical research and detailed field measurements to accurately define the boundary, which had not been resurveyed since the original Crown alienation. This project allowed me to hone my technical skills in both the field and the office, further solidifying my ability to handle complex survey tasks.
<p>
In addition to fieldwork, I played a key role in processing data collected from the field, using advanced software to reduce and interpret data, producing detailed survey plans. Over time, I also took on leadership responsibilities, coordinating smaller projects and leading surveys from planning to execution. This experience enhanced my project management and leadership skills, allowing me to manage both field and office tasks efficiently.
<p>
Through my work at JCA Land Consultants, I have gained strong proficiency in using a variety of tools and software such as AutoCAD, Civil 3D, and other survey-specific programs. My ability to apply technical skills in real-world projects, combined with a growing understanding of the broader surveying industry, has prepared me to take on more advanced roles in the future as I work towards becoming a fully qualified Land Surveyor.
